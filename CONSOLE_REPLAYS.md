This guide will cover how to setup your Wii to record Slippi Replays.

There are a few things that will be required to setup console replays:

*   A Wii running homebrew
*   A SD card with an unmodified NTSC 1.02 ISO on it
*   A USB formatted to some FAT format (FAT16, FAT32, or exFAT)

**This guide will not cover setting up homebrew on your wii.** Please take a look at [Kadano‚Äôs guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iaPI7Mb5fCzsLLLuEeQuR9-BeR8AOwvHyU-FM8GKmEs) for that.

**This guide will not cover setting up mirroring with Slippi.** Please take a look at our [Mirroring guide](https://github.com/project-slippi/project-slippi/wiki/Console-Mirroring-Guide) for that.

Extract the zip onto your SD card.

_The zip contains an ‚Äúapps‚Äù folder that can be placed in the root of your SD card_

The Melee ISO should be copied to your SD card to the following path
```
    SD:/games/<pick a folder name>/game.iso
```

_You may have more apps, but these are the important ones_

Load slippi-wiiconf

![alt_text](https://i.ibb.co/5GKpR1r/unnamed-4.png "image_tooltip")
Navigate to Slippi Settings (Network Settings don‚Äôt work) and set the time and console name (pick something unique so you can differentiate your replays from those made on different consoles)

![alt_text](https://i.ibb.co/x6fyJC8/unnamed-5.png "image_tooltip")
_The nickname is written into the replay files and the time is used as the file name_

Back out to the homebrew channel

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step 4 - Nintendont</span>**

Load Nintendont-Slippi

Select SD and then press B to access the settings menu

If your region uses a controller fix (UCF and/or Dween) or Frozen Pokemon stadium, make sure to set the settings here in the Nintendont settings so your replays work with the Slippi Desktop App.
